# local_ai

This project aims to run locally an AI model like ChatGPT.
Based on the model from deepseek, in particular deepseek-r1:8b.

## load_model.py

This script loads the model and runs it locally on a terminal.
So this is not the file we want to run to expose the API but if we have to test some behavior of the model, this is the file to use.
